### Tutorials Content

1. **Using Hooks to Analyze Gradients and Activations**: [PytorchHook.ipynb](PytorchHook.ipynb) In this tutorial, you will learn how to use hooks in PyTorch to inspect and analyze gradients and activations in a pre-trained ResNet-18 model. You'll discover how to register hooks on specific layers of the model to capture gradients or activations during both forward and backward propagation, and how to visualize this information for analysis and debugging of your models.
